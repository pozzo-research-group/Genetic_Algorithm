This folder contains example code to re-produce plots in the paper.

1. Figure 2

Code used to generate Figrue 2 from the paper is provided as an iPython notebook in `01_distance_example_figure2.ipynb` 

2. Gaussian example case study

The python file `gaussians.py` contains code to re-produce case study 1 from the paper comapring two metrics using simulated dataset.

3. Experimental campaigns

Data from the experimental campaigns are provided in the folder `expt`. This data was generated in the exact same way as described in the repo README.md for a simulation case study adapted for experiments with a robot in the loop.
 
Code required to reproduce Figure 5, 6 are provided in the `02-expt_postprocess.ipynb` that makes use of the data in the `expt` folder.
